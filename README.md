# React Boilerplate (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This repository serves as a boilerplate for building React applications using Vite and Tailwind CSS. It provides a fast development environment and a streamlined production build process.

## Getting Started

### Start the Development Server
To start the development server, run the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Vite development server and allow you to preview your application in the browser.

### Build for Production
To create a production build, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will generate optimized assets in the `dist` folder.

### Run Test Cases and Coverage
To run test cases and check coverage, use:
```bash
npm test
```
This will execute the test suite and provide coverage reports.

### Run Prettier and Lint Fix
To format your code and fix linting issues, use:
```bash
npm run format
npm run lint:fix
```
The `format` command runs Prettier to format your code, and `lint:fix` fixes linting errors automatically.
